                <h3>Rubies</h3>
                <p>Some interesting facts on rubies. Belive it or not, rubies are one of the most expensive gemstones on the market. They value
                    in corolation to there rarity and purity. Rubies are consistantly made of three oxygen atoms and two aluminum atoms. 
                    The word ruby comes from the Latin rubens, which means red. And in actuality, a ruby is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone
                    not purly red. And although rubies are said to be found all around the world, the reason they are marketed at a high value
                    is becuase they are found in small quantities.

                <h3>Diamonds</h3>
                <p>Oh the diamond. The mark of beauty and a symbole for love. But that's not all diamonds stand for. Diamonds are, if not, the 
                    strongest mineral to ever exist. Diamonds are formed deep below the earths mantel. Why you may ask. Diamonds are formed only 
                    under certain conditions. This being high heat and pressure. And the earths mantel provides that. Of course you see diamonds 
                    all over the place. People where them, jewelry stores, ect. And because of that, many people like to create fakes in order to 
                    to line their pockets. However, due to the rapid advancment in technology, we had created way to detect such things.
